              This essay explores the theme of spirituality in the art of Syed Haider Raza, an iconic Indian
              artist of the 20th and early 21st centuries. It examines the various components that align with the
              events in his life, recur in his work, and are brought out through vibrant colours. The paper
              critically analyzes the inherent spirituality and dense symbolism that Raza embeds in his motifs.
              These motifs, such as the visual and philosophical metaphor of 'The Bindu' or the 'DOT,' provide
              insights into Raza's creative mind. The essay underscores what American writer James Baldwin
              astutely posits, "Art's purpose lies in unveiling the questions veiled by answers," which aptly encapsulates Raza's transcendent oeuvre.

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          February 22, 1922. A simple date. But on this ordinary day, a luminary would be born. This
          legend burned his footprint into the visual art map with the ever-burning flame of his work that
          transcended the rudimentary boundaries of words. Syed Haider Raza’s work is replete with
          abstraction yet adroitly unfolding to reveal the pages of his journey. His art unveils the layered
          spirituality he imbibes with three religious experiences; three distinct cords intertwine to form
          an unbreakable knot, a unique meld. Raza was Muslim by birth, married to a Christian and
          socialized and interacted in a Hindu environment (in his nascent years.) 2023 marks the
          centenary year of Syed Haider Raza. He is lauded as one of the foremost Indian painters, along with contemporaries from the Progressive Art Group in India, such as M.F. Hussain, F.N.
          Souza and others, creating a unique space for the modern Indian painter in the visual art world
          map. Raza’s art characterises a confluence of Western expression and Indian symbolism,
          allowing for the development of a fascinating essay critically examining the spiritual in abstract
          art. The essay first begins to explore the theme of colour, spirituality and art and takes, for
          example, the series titled ‘Saurashtra’. The essay then proceeds to analyse complexities of
          spirituality in an earlier series titled ‘Bindu’- the dot, that conveyed a fascinating intricacy of
          spiritual thought woven in geometry, colours, lines and brush strokes. Each painting is a rich
          tapestry that weaves the individual threads of many experiences and perspectives.
        </p><br />

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          He was a master colourist. He believed art meditates with colour. Colour was the expression
          of passion and feeling, and colour allowed the painter to meditate. Colour is not merely an
          expression but a medium for self-expression, self-questioning, and self-exploration.”
          (Benhamou).
        </p><br />
        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          From the perspective of colour psychology, there is a general acceptance that colours impact
          perceptions, emotions, and mood (Mohr). For Raza, colours were paths to exploring inner
          spiritual landscapes.
        </p><br />

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Any lofty, robust tree must have branching and staunch roots. The seed of Raza’s growth was
          planted in a small village in Madhya Pradesh, India, from where he travelled to Bombay- where
          thousands of the populace arrived, hoping the urbanscape would give them success. His final
          destination was France, where he trained, married a French artist, settled, and remained by
          choice in his life and art ‘Indian’.
        </p><br />

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Even in childhood, Raza was enchanted by the infinite Elysium of nature that made his
          hometown of Bambariya thrum with life- the songs of verdant green forests and the sempiternal
          beauty of the cascading Narmada. This deep affinity for nature and the beauty of the landscape
          likely pushed him to pursue landscape art, spanning much of his early career. His love for nature
          is evident through his hunger for colour and artistic ferocity, even when he was a budding artist
          still lacking the influences he needed to blossom truly.
        </p><br />

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Raza discovered vision when he travelled to coastal Mumbai, the city of dreams, where the
          boundless urban landscapes of buildings and the infinity of the sea provided another perspective
          to his sensibilities. Other journeys, such as the one to Kashmir and then to France, expanded the
          palette of perceptions. . Raza lived in France for over six decades, where he married a French
          artist. Still, the magnetic pull of his motherland was irrefutable, so he kept returning home to the
          land of vibrant, coruscating, living colours. For instance, his famous series ‘Saurashtra' shows
          evidence. Apart from his experiences, Raza’s sense of color also came from the miniature
          paintings of India.
        </p><br />

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Done in the early 1980s, the series of his works ‘Saurashtra’ is all emotional and geometrical
          expressional painting seeking to capture what poet Ashok Vajpeyi describes of Raza’s work “inheritance and invention, modernity and memory, celebration, and spirituality” (Benhamou,
          Ashok Vajpeyi, poet and director of the Raza foundation about Raza).
        </p><br />

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          The series ‘Saurashtra’ came after another famous series of Raza’s paintings, ' Bindu'.
          ‘Saurashtra’ was about the geographical Western arid landscape in the State of Gujarat where
          people, in contrast to the background, wear vigorously spirited, vibrant riot, living and even
          psychedelic colours. The painted abstract strokes navigating the geometrical spacing seem
          inspired by the colours of the Rajasthani miniature paintings between the 16th and 19th
          centuries. Ochre, crimson, deep-red brown, and green, reminiscent of the dusty, languorous,
          sultry, dry land with scintillas of green representing occasional oases. Raza writes, “Instead of <a href="https://youtu.be/Cit5cH2vms0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://youtu.be/Cit5cH2vms0</a> being constructions, my paintings from the 1970s are more gestural in techniques, and in terms
          of colour, too, they are expressionistic. The spontaneity was new and compulsive – I let the
          canvas grow.” The ‘Saurashtra’ series of Raza’s paintings are abstract, but there is a spiritual 4
          journey. These paintings form part of the artist’s transitional phase, where he seeks to explore his
          inner self and aspires to balance his inner growth and interaction with the outer world. The
          paintings are representative of his psychic sojourn where “ the distortion of forms and lines
          correspond to the struggle of his state of mind, a reverse journey from experience to innocence,
          tracking back his rootedness to the native place, where he was born, weaving the relationship
          with nature and meadows and the social and cultural landscape.”(Banu)
        </p><br />

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Some of the most illustrious works of Raza’s repertoire were greatly catalyzed by the “Bindu”
          incident in his school days when a teacher was disciplining him to soothe the agitation in his
          mind. He instructed Raza to concentrate on a “Bindu”, a black dot on the classroom wall.
          Spellbound, Raza spent hours fixated on this ostensibly insignificant dot. He became enthralled
          by this Bindu, and this would be a recurring symbol in his later works. The hours spent gazing at
          the dot returned with a force that grew into a phenomenal artistic and spiritual journey, making
          Raza what he became and is celebrated for.

          Raza left for France in 1950 but returned to India regularly. He would often say that he learned
          to paint in France and what to paint he learned from India. The Bindu was part of his journey to
          move away from the Cubist and figurative forms and experiment with expressional art. He
          needed to address his restless mind, and that was when he returned to his childhood event of
          gazing at the black dot called Bindu. The Bindu became a larger-than-life multilayered
          philosophical symbol. “It represented the seed, a natural symbol of fertility, the cyclical nature
          of the seasons, the circle of life and death that cannot be broken. Spiritually, it signified a
          powerful source or seat of energy and creation, a point of meditation. Raza has himself
          described the Bindu as a “...visible form containing all the essential requisites of line, tone,
          color, texture and space.” (Bordewekar)

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          “Sayed Haider Raza has set a new record seven years after he died. The Indian Modern artist’s
          acrylic on canvas Gestation (1989) fetched ₹51.75 crore, including commissions, at Pundole
          Auction House a little over a week ago, making it the most expensive Indian artwork ever sold
          at auction.”
        </p><br />
        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          The demand for his artwork is testimony to the importance of his legacy. To celebrate his
          centenary, the Raza Foundation ( an arts and culture organization established in 2001 by Raza
          which aims to create dialogic spaces for various arts, poetry, ideas, etc.), along with Centre
          Pompidou in Paris, organised an exhibition (15 February-15 May 2023). It was specially curated
          to demonstrate Raza’s free-flowing and
          unfettered oeuvre, including early works from his days in the Sir J.J. School of Art. The
          exhibition aimed to establish the role of Sayed Haider Raza as a significant artist who bridged
          Western and South Asian sensibilities, artistic genres, styles, techniques, aesthetics and
          philosophical and spiritual ideas. Raza was decorated in India; he received the fourth highest
          civilian award, the Padma Shri, in 1981, the Fellowship of the Lalit Kala Academi ( the National
          Academy of Visual Arts in India) in 1984, the third highest civilian award, Padma Bhushan in
          2007 and Padma Vibhushan the second highest civilian honour in 2013. Raza left his mortal
          body on July 23rd, 2016. “The Goblin of death in Terry Pratchett’s acclaimed novel Reaper Man
          famously said: “No one is dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away.” Even a small
          insignificant pebble can create mammoth ripples. The rich legacy left behind by Raza can testify
          <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/artists/sayed-haider-raza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(https://www.sothebys.com/en/artists/sayed-haider-raza)</a>
          to the numerous perennial ripples which continue to stir and give directions to others. A mute
          witness to this is the painting he was making before his death, which rests on the easel for
          posterity ( in his studio in Delhi). “A black circle whirling on its axis would begin its journey,
          rising from an ocean of white, and dynamise the room.” The last unfinished painting seems to 8
          be the high point of Raza’s flying soul recreating his abstractly painted spiritual journey!

            I like to call myself an expressionist. From the visual arts, writing, dance, and drama to TED-Ed, ventriloquism and playing the guitar, the arts paved the way for me to express myself. Art and English empower me to create mimeses- to tell stories that can shape reality. They transcend the simple boundaries of words, offering insight into the creator’s mind- the pain, pathos and thought.  I’ve been writing since I could form a sentence and I haven’t stopped since then. For as long as I can remember, I’ve aspired to be an author and illustrator. My oeuvre also includes having participated in a 21-day poetry challenge and my collection of poems has recently been published. My curiosity in understanding the luminary Sir Saiyed H. Raza’s abstract art drove me to write a research paper to further understand the spirituality and philosophy behind his fierce unerasable burn onto the visual art world map. I’m passionate about battling societal issues that plague our world using my pen and paintbrush as weapons. I participated in the Young Leaders for Active Citizenship Program (YLAC) and was recognized as the ‘Fellow of the fellowship,’ for advocating gender equality, mental wellbeing, anti-bullying and diversity. A recent essay submission of mine to the internationally acclaimed VSA Elaine Hobson Memorial Literary Festival has been handpicked to be showcased at the 2024 Global Empathy conference in Prague, where I’ve been invited to present virtually to the audience in May 2024.

            The path to success is paved with hard work, but also cobbled with curiosity. As a firm believer in standing up for what is right, I hope to thrive unfettered and find freedom of expression, thereby creating content that will amplify my voice across different audiences across the world.
