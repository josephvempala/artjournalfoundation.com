              What’s the last observation you made, and do you clearly remember about it? My
              observation about children playing on a soccer field with loud noises and colored t-
              shirts that they cheer out loud for goal. Have you ever wondered if this
              consciousness is turning the light on? I found my balance with observation, which
              lightens me up and graces me with creativity.

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Building observation is a significant process that is built upon with the senses.
          As an educator, my children get ample opportunities to play together with
          friends outdoors, observe birds, and see birds flying to swing along with friends in
          the park, which simply lays the foundation to connect with the sounds of nature.
          They oftenly go busy in collecting leaves, twigs and flowers fallen around, some
          often begin to count, compare who has more to just picking up flowers and
          gifting me. I gently bring them into the present moment and make them
          conscious of enjoying the present moment.
        </p><br />
        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Thoughts are the dry expressions of the mind; emotions make them juicy. We
          make these little humans understand that you must be able to direct it the way
          you wish. Unleash your power to be present in the moment. Once they deeply
          touch their lives by being conscious humans and not just being ordinary, they will
          turn other lives extraordinary. Observation is built upon with various consistent
          practices, building on a learning environment full of calm colors to be closer to
          nature, which allows for connecting with peers and a free flow of expression.
          Establishing a culture of mindfulness and observation will certainly have an
          absolute impact.
        </p><br />

        <h2 className="section-subtitle" style={{ color: '#ff9900', textAlign: 'left' }}>Enhance-embrace-encourage with right
          questioning :-</h2><br />
        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          The power of observation will bring enormous vision, which will bring creativity to
          every aspect of life. It's creativity that will transform you and your memory. As
          an educator, simple breathing techniques like star breathing, bee breathing,
          rainbow breathing, and many more have worked on my children and brought them
          back to the present moment. My favorite of all would be ‘bumble bee breathing’
          as I sing rhymingly. Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Take a couple of
          breaths. Breathe in through your nose, keeping your lips sealed. As you breathe
          out, hum a ‘M’ sound. At the end of your breath, breathe in and repeat.
          Now learners are ready as their energies and thoughts are in well balanced and
          they are ready to be one in the moment. I begin my journey with empathetic
          questioning, “how did that made you feel” or “what sounds did you hear when we
          were on a walk in the park?’ to “what do you think lives in a big tree? Which
          allows me to check on learner’s emotions and feelings

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          A right questioning technique enables the educator to walk along with learners.
          While finding and building upon shapes and colors, I ask questions like, ‘Can you
          find something in the room that’s shaped like a circle?" or while painting, asking
          them, "What kind of pictures should we paint today?"
        </p><br />
        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          My learners feel empowered, and we feel connected in class, which boosts self-
          confidence and brings along joy. Now learners have visualized and formed
          connections with learning and spending time with their environment.

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          As an educator, following a model of the 3 C's—choices, challenges, and
          celebrations— allows my learners to make choices within reasonable limits.
          Challenges that require problem solving and critical thinking further lead to
          overcoming challenges, which further boost confidence.

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          My inner vision of keeping children happy and feeling good as they spend their
          formative time of the day with me carries a great responsibility. My words like
          ‘You are my sunshine’, ‘you make me smile’ to 'I believe in you' work as great
          motivators. The positive words spoken give them a smile. As an educator I
          embrace their mistakes and give them a power to think creatively at any
          problem with a solution maker mindset.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          My idea of working towards believing that observation and visualization can
          transform their learning process with ease and comfort is that all they have to
          do is be present in the moment and just allow their thoughts to flow.
        </p>

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          We join in with rhymes and play a game of different scenarios to solve puzzles,
          bringing along many skills of problem solving, building upon thinking skills, and
          making connections.

        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Now little humans have begun to express happiness, joy, yays, and nays, which
          has given them a pack of good feelings. Now they look more positive and
          exuberant with energies. As an educator, I have won their hearts, and positivity
          of thought will lead to a better acceptance of thoughts and response.
        </p><br />
        <p className="section-paragraph" style={{ color: '#333' }}>
          Let our energies be exuberant and focused, as this is our time to be spectacular.
